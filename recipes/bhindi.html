            Traditional spicy okra curry that everyone loves. It's best with Indian bread (naan or paratha) or rice. My mom says this is brain food!

        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups okra, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the okra in a large, microwave-safe dish; cook in microwave on High for 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil and cumin seeds together in a large skillet over medium heat until the cumin seeds swell and turn golden brown. Fry the onions in the heated oil for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes to the mixture and cook another 3 minutes. Stir the okra into the mixture; season with the curry powder and salt. Cook and stir the mixture until hot, about 3 minutes more. Serve hot.</li>
